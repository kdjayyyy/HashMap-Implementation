<h1>HashMap Implementation using C++</h1>

## Project Description

This project is a basic implementation of a hashmap using the separate chaining technique. The hashmap is designed to map a string type key to a value of any data type, represented using templates. 

## Features

- **String Hashing**: A hash of the key is created using a function that utilizes a string hashing technique. This ensures a unique identifier for each key-value pair in the hashmap.
- **Basic Operations**: The hashmap can perform the basic tasks of searching, inserting, and removing a chosen key-value pair.
- **Update Functionality**: The hashmap can also update the value of a key if it already exists in it.

## Usage

To use this hashmap in your code, include the header file and create an instance of the hashmap. You can then use the provided functions to interact with the hashmap.
